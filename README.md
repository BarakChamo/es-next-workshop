#ES Next Workshop
######A hands-on workshop on the new feautures of JavaScript

<br/>

###Following the workshop:

To follow the workshop go through the different chapters listed below.

Each chapter includes:
- A brief overview of a new feature of JavaScript, how it compares to old versions and how to use it.
- A link to extended documentation for that feature.
- A small challenge to practice the new features and concepts.
- The solution for the challenge (after you did it on your own, obviously!)


###Trying out ES Next features:

To follow along and write ES Next code, go to the [Babel online REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl/#?evaluate=true&lineWrap=false&presets=es2015%2Creact%2Cstage-0%2Cstage-1%2Cstage-2%2Cstage-3).

It will allow to write ES6 and 7 in the browser and provide you with the compiled ES5 output and console preview.
